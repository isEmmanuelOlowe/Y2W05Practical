<!--l. 20--><p class="noindent" >To gain experience with Test Driven Development and implementing and testing Abstract Data
Types.
<!--l. 22--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-2000"></a>Learning Outcomes</h4>
<!--l. 24--><p class="noindent" >By the end of this practical you should understand:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">how to design and implement unit tests
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">how to use a Test Driven Development methodology to produce a robust implementation of a
     specified ADT interface.</li></ul>

   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-3000"></a>Getting started</h4>
<!--l. 34--><p class="noindent" >To start with, you should create a suitable assignment directory such as <span 
class="pcrr7t-">CS2001/W05-JUnit </span>on the Linux lab
clients. You should decompress the <span 
class="pcrr7t-">zip </span>file at
<div class="center" 
>
<!--l. 36--><p class="noindent" >
<!--l. 37--><p class="noindent" ><a

class="pcrr7t-">http://studres.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/CS2001/Practicals/W05-JUnit/code.zip</span></a></div>
<!--l. 40--><p class="noindent" >to your assignment directory. Please note that the <span 
class="pcrr7t-">zip </span>file contains a number of files in the <span 
class="pcrr7t-">src </span>directory, some
of which are blank or only partially implemented. <span 
class="pplb7t-">Once you have extracted the </span><span 
class="pcrb7t-">zip </span><span 
class="pplb7t-">file, you should probably</span>
<span 
class="pplb7t-">delete it to avoid accidentally overwriting your </span><span 
class="pcrb7t-">src </span><span 
class="pplb7t-">directory (and thereby your own implementation) with</span>
<span 
class="pplb7t-">files contained in the </span><span 
class="pcrb7t-">zip</span><span 
class="pplb7t-">.</span>
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
<!--l. 45--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-4000"></a>Requirements</h4>
<!--l. 47--><p class="noindent" >You are to develop an implementation of the ADT interfaces for a shop, stock records and products in the
<span 
class="pcrr7t-">interfaces </span>package in the <span 
class="pcrr7t-">src </span>directory following a TDD process. That is, your job is to write suitable tests
in the <span 
class="pcrr7t-">test </span>package (such as in the supplied <span 
class="pcrr7t-">Tests </span>class) and implement all the classes in the <span 
class="pcrr7t-">impl </span>package to
satisfy these tests. Parts of <span 
class="pcrr7t-">impl.Factory </span>have been implemented, for this class you only need to implement
the methods containing <span 
class="pcrr7t-">// TODO </span>comments. <br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 50--><p class="noindent" >Please note that you must <span 
class="pplb7t-">NOT </span>change the interfaces. Coding to a given interface is an important
aspect of development and is seen as a valuable exercise for this assignment and many others.
<!--l. 52--><p class="noindent" >Following the TDD process, try to write <span 
class="pcrr7t-">JUnit5 </span>tests for each element of functionality before writing and
testing its implementation. When writing your tests, consider the following:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Normal cases, with expected inputs.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Edge cases, such as empty collections, duplicate bar codes for different products, no stock.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Exceptional cases, such as dealing with <span 
class="pcrr7t-">null</span>s.</li></ul>
<!--l. 63--><p class="noindent" >Should you find some aspects of the interfaces ambiguous, you will need to make a decision as to how to
implement the interface, which your tests should make clear.
<!--l. 68--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-5000"></a>Running the Automated Checker</h4>
<!--l. 69--><p class="noindent" >You can run the automated checking system on your program by opening a terminal window connected to the
Linux lab clients/servers and executing the following commands:

<!--l. 74--><p class="nopar" >
<!--l. 76--><p class="noindent" >assuming <span 
class="pcrr7t-">CS2001/W05-JUnit </span>is your assignment directory. This will run your own JUnit tests in the <span 
class="pcrr7t-">test</span>
package on your own ADT implementation. A single test method is included in a <span 
class="pcrr7t-">Tests </span>class in the <span 
class="pcrr7t-">test</span>
package. It merely checks that the factory method for creating a product (which you will have to
implement) calls a suitable product constructor (which you will also have to implement). The test also
demonstrates how to use the factory to instantiate objects. Your first step could be to make this failing test
succeed before going on to add the next failing test(s), adding the corresponding implementation,
re-running all tests etc. in the TDD process. The final test <span 
class="pcrr7t-">TestQ CheckStyle </span>runs a program
called Checkstyle over your source code using the <span 
class="pplri7t-">Kirby Style </span>as mentioned for the exercise in week
1.

<!--l. 86--><p class="noindent" >Hand in via MMS, by the deadline of 9pm on Wednesday of Week 5, a zip file containing:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Your   assignment   directory   with   all   your   source   code,   including   your   tests   and   ADT
     implementations.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">A PDF report describing your test cases, how you chose those test cases, and how your choice of
     test cases influenced the implementation of your ADT. You should also explain and justify your
     design and implementation decisions in clarity and detail.</li></ul>

   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a

found at:

<!--l. 102--><p class="noindent" >A very good attempt in an object-oriented fashion achieving almost all required functionality, together with a
clear report showing a good level of understanding, can achieve a mark of 14 - 16. This means you should
produce very good, re-usable code with very good method decomposition and provide a very good set of
tests with clear explanations and justifications of design and implementation decisions in your
report. To achieve a mark of 17 or above, you will need to implement all required functionality
with a comprehensive set of test cases, testing all aspects of your design and covering any cases.
Quality and clarity of design, implementation, testing, and your report are key at the top end.
